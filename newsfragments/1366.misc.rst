Devices keys filenames are no longer meaningful.

Device key files used to be stored in a directory named after the device slug
in a file also named after the same device slug. As a result, the device path
used to be very long (about 200 characters).

Device key files are now stored directly in the devices directory using the
device slughash and the `.keys` extension. The path is now much shorter
